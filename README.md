OBJECTIVE:The primary objective of a basic weather application in Python is to provide users with convenient access to real-time and forecasted weather information for specific locations. This typically involves:
Fetching Weather Data:
Utilizing external Application Programming Interfaces (APIs), such as OpenWeatherMap, to retrieve current weather conditions and forecasts for a given city or location. This often involves making HTTP requests and parsing the received data, which is commonly in JSON format.
Displaying Key Weather Information:
Presenting essential meteorological data to the user in a clear and understandable manner. This includes, but is not limited to:
Current temperature (and potentially "feels like" temperature)
Humidity levels
Wind speed and direction
Precipitation type and intensity (e.g., rain, snow)
Cloud cover
Sunrise and sunset times.

STEP PERFORMED
Building a basic weather application in Python typically involves the following steps:
Obtain a Weather API Key:
Sign up for an account with a weather data provider (e.g., OpenWeatherMap, Weatherstack).
Generate an API key from your account dashboard. This key will authenticate your requests to the weather API.
Install Necessary Libraries:
Install the requests library, which is used to make HTTP requests to the API.
Code
    pip install requests
    
Import Modules and Configure:
Import the requests module in your Python script.
Store your API key and the base URL for the weather API.

TOOL USED:
A basic weather application in Python typically utilizes the following tools and concepts:
OpenWeatherMap API:
This is a widely used service that provides access to current weather data, forecasts, and historical weather information. A free API key can be obtained from their website and is essential for fetching weather data.
requests module:
This Python library is used to make HTTP requests to the OpenWeatherMap API. It allows the application to send requests to the API endpoint and receive the weather data in response, typically in JSON format.
json module:
After receiving the weather data from the API, it is often in JSON format. The json module is used to parse this data, allowing the application to extract specific information like temperature, humidity, weather description, etc.

OUTCOME
A basic weather application in Python, leveraging a weather API like OpenWeatherMap, typically yields the following outcomes:
Real-time Weather Information:
The primary outcome is the ability to retrieve and display current weather conditions for a specified city. This includes data points such as temperature, humidity, pressure, and a textual description of the weather (e.g., "clear sky," "partly cloudy").
User Interaction:
The application provides a mechanism for users to input a city name, usually through a command-line interface or a graphical user interface (GUI) built with libraries like Tkinter.
API Integration:
It demonstrates the practical application of integrating with external APIs to fetch dynamic data. This involves making HTTP requests to the weather API endpoint and parsing the JSON response to extract relevant weather details.
Error Handling:
A robust basic weather app incorporates error handling to manage scenarios like invalid city names, network connectivity issues, or API key problems, providing informative messages to the user instead of crashing.
